# k8s-michigan-configs

This repo was created to document the work I have been doing on my home pi lab.  I am working with a (3) raspberry pi cluster.  I have K3S running on all of them and am working on setting up a working CI/CD that is as lightweight as possible.  

As a huge Michigan Wolverines fan, I am keeping a Michigan theme as I work through all of the iterations.

Enjoy, and #goblue
